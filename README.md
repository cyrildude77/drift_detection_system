# drift_detection_system
🔍 Overview

This project implements a complete Data & Concept Drift Detection Pipeline designed for real-world machine learning systems where data changes over time can silently degrade model performance.

The system monitors streaming or batch data, identifies different types of drift (linear, non-linear, and statistical anomalies), logs drift events into a SQL database, triggers alerts, and supports proactive retraining.

This project is architected using:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) → detects linear drift

LSTM Autoencoder → detects non-linear drift

Statistical Tests → detects distribution drift

SQL Logging Pipeline

Visualizer for Drift Reports

It’s built to demonstrate strong ML engineering skills and real-world model maintenance principles.

🚀 Key Features
1. Multi-Model Drift Detection

The system uses three independent techniques to detect drift:

🔹 PCA Reconstruction Error

Good for linear pattern changes

Detects shifts in directional variance

Fast and efficient

🔹 LSTM Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss

Captures non-linear, temporal patterns

Best for time-series or sequential drift

Resistant to noise and sudden spikes

🔹 Statistical Drift Tests

Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS Test)

Population Stability Index (PSI)
Used to detect distribution-level changes between reference and new data.

2. Automated Event Logging

Drift events are saved with:

Timestamp

Model used

Reconstruction error / KS score / PSI score

Drift severity

Drift type (linear, nonlinear, statistical)

Database backend:

Primary: MySQL

Fallback: SQLite (auto-switch)

3. Monitoring Pipeline

Included:

Windowing-based time series processor

Normalization using StandardScaler

Real-time drift percentage calculator

Threshold-based alerting

4. Visual Drift Report Generator

Visual outputs include:

Reconstruction error plots

KS distribution graphs

PSI trend charts

⚙️ How It Works — Architecture
Step 1 — Preprocessing

Normalization

Sliding window creation

Temporal batch segmentation

Step 2 — Drift Detection

Each incoming batch is compared against reference data:

🔸 PCA

Reconstructs data → calculates error → compares with threshold.

🔸 LSTM Autoencoder

Learns normal patterns → error spikes = drift.

🔸 Statistical Tests

KS Test → compares CDFs

PSI → compares bin distributions

Step 3 — Drift Flagging

If error/stat score > threshold:

Drift event created

Drift severity computed

Logged in SQL database

Step 4 — Visualization

Generate charts for:

RE distribution

Drift timestamps

Statistical scores

🛠️ Installation

📚 Why Multi-Model Drift Detection?

Different drifts require different detectors:

Drift Type	Example	Best Detector
Linear Drift	Gradually increasing values	PCA
Non-Linear Drift	Sudden pattern breaks	LSTM Autoencoder
Distribution Drift	Value ranges change	KS Test / PSI

Using multiple detectors ensures higher reliability, especially for real-world noisy data.
